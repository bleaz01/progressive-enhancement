        <!--Story-->
		    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said,</p>
            <blockquote><em class="villageois">“We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.”</em></blockquote>
            <p> The farmer said,</p><blockquote><strong class="agriculteur">“Is it <b class="good">good</b>? Is it <b class="bad">bad</b>? I don't know..”</strong>
            </blockquote><p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,</p><blockquote><em class="villageois">
            “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!”</em></blockquote><p>The farmer again said,</p><blockquote>
            <strong class="agriculteur">“Is it <b class="good">good</b>? Is it <b class="bad">bad</b>? I don't know.”</strong></blockquote>
		    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,</p>
            <blockquote><em class="villageois">“Oh dear, that’s too <b class="bad">bad</b>,” </em></blockquote><p>and the farmer responded,</p><blockquote>
            <strong class="agriculteur">“Is it <b class="good">good</b>? Is it <b class="bad">bad</b>? I don't know.”</strong></blockquote>
            <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,</p>
            <blockquote><em class="villageois"> “Isn’t that great!”</em></blockquote><p>Again, he said</p><blockquote>
            <strong class="agriculteur">“Is it <b class="good">good</b>? Is it <b class="bad">bad</b>? I don't know.”</strong></blockquote>

        <blockquote>
			<p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens 
            in it is <b class="good">good</b> or <b class="bad">bad</b> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you 
            never know what will be the consequences of <b class="good">good</b> fortune.</p>

		<p><b class="good">Good</b> and <b class="bad">Bad</b> are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it..</p>
